def parse_command_line_options():
    
    This function will return a command line option
    
    return option
    
    
def stopcodons_postion():
    
    This function will take a sequence and record all stop codons position with 3 frames
    
    supposed to return a dictionary
    
    key : frame information
    
    value: a list of stop codons position
    

def find_startcodon():
    
    This function will break the sequence into a series of small sequence according to the stopcodons_position()
     
    Ensure every small sequence only has one stop codon
    
    Find the start codon in each small sequence and record both start codon and stop codon position
    
    should deal with the situation where small sequence doesn't have start codon(try-except)
    
    supposed to return a dictionary
    
    key: frame information
    
    value: a list of start and stop codon pair
    
    may be like this 
    
    {'frame':[[start,stop],[start,stop]]
    

def extract_UTR5_CDS_postion():

    This function will extract start and end position of UTR5 and CDS in each sequence
    

def check_length():

    This fuction will check if the length of orf meets the users' requirement
    

def check_uorf_type():

    This funtion will check the which type the  uorf  belongs to
